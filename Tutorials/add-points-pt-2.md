This is the second in a [series of tutorials](https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/help/#add-points-to-a-map) that will teach you how to add points to a map using the Mapbox Studio dataset editor, the Mapbox Studio style editor, and Mapbox GL JS.

*Part 2* focuses on the Mapbox Studio style editor. In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Create a new style using one of the Mapbox default styles
- Add a tileset as a layer
- Style the new layer
- Publish your style

}}

## Getting started

There are a few resources you will need to follow along with this guide:

- **Tileset.** You will need a tileset containing 10 Chicago parks. You can learn how to create this tileset in [Add points to a web map, Part 1: create a dataset](/help/tutorials/add-points-pt-1).
- **Custom icon.** This tutorial uses a custom icon to show the location of the parks. You will need to download the SVG icon to use in your style.

</Button>
}}

## Add data to a style

Web maps are comprised of [map tiles](/help/how-mapbox-works/web-apps/). To add your data to a web map, Mapbox will cut it up into tiles so the data can display at various zoom levels. The collection of tiles that Mapbox cuts your map into is called a tileset. In [Add points to a web map, part 1: create a dataset](/help/tutorials/add-points-pt-1), you converted a dataset into a tileset to add it to a new map style.

### Create a new style

After finishing [Add points to a web map, part 1: create a dataset](/help/tutorials/add-points-pt-1), create a new style using the Basic template. On your [Styles page](https://studio.mapbox.com/styles) in Mapbox Studio, click the **New style** button. Find the _Basic Template_ style and click **Customize Basic Template**.

The style editor will open automatically. Rename your new style to _Chicago Parks_ using the title field in the upper left side of the screen.

}}

### Create a new layer

You will add your tileset as a new layer here:

1. When the style editor opens, click **+ Add layer** in the upper left.
2. In the list of _Data sources_, find your **chicago-parks** tileset, click the name of the tileset, and then click the source layer that appears to add it as the source for the layer.

{{
  <AppropriateImage
    imageId="addPointsPt2AddLayer"
    alt="screenshot illustrating how to add a new layer in Mapbox Studio"
  />
}}

3. Mapbox Studio recognizes that the data you have uploaded is focused on a different location, so it displays the message _"This tileset isn't available from your map view."_ Click **Go to data**, and the map view will refocus on Chicago.
4. Click the **Type** option, and then choose the _Symbol_ layer option so you can create a layer with [markers](/help/glossary/marker/).
5. Click back to the **Style** tab.

  />
}}

## Style a layer

In the Mapbox Studio style editor, you can specify the style properties of each layer. This includes the layers in the Mapbox default styles and any layers youâ€™ve added with custom data. For this example, you will style a *symbol* layer. You can style symbol layers with both text and icons.

### Style as a symbol layer

1. Click on the **chicago-parks** layer you created in the layer list on the left side of the style editor.
2. When the style panel opens, click the **Style** tab if you're not already there.
3. Select the **Icon** tab and click on **Manage icons in your spritesheet**.
4. This opens the **Images** option in the top toolbar.

  />
}}

5. Click the **Upload SVG Image** button to and choose the marker you downloaded at the beginning of this tutorial from your files.
6. Once the icon has loaded, choose it from the list.

{{
  <AppropriateImage
    imageId="addPointsPt2SelectIcon"
    alt="screenshot demonstrating the upload SVG menu in Mapbox studio"
  />
}}

7. If you would like to show all the markers, even if they overlap, click on the **Placement** tab. Scroll down to **Allow icon overlap** and set it to `True`.

You should now see the marker icon appear on all your points.

  />
}}

## Publish a style

Now that you have finished styling your map, you need to publish your style for those changes to be live on the web.

1. Click the **Publish** button in the top right of the editor.
2. A window will pop up asking you to review your changes.
3. Click **Publish**.

## Share

The [Share modal](https://docs.mapbox.com/studio-manual/overview/publish-your-style/) contains the resources you need to publish your style in a web app, mobile app, or with another third-party tool.

### Share

Click **Share** in the upper right of the style editor. The Share modal contains a share URL that allows you to share a preview of your style with others. The modal also contains a style URL and your access token, both of which you will need in [part three of this tutorial](/help/tutorials/add-points-pt-3/).

## Next Steps

Head to [Add points to a web map, part 3: add interactivity](/help/tutorials/add-points-pt-3/) to add popups with information about each park to your map using Mapbox GL JS.
